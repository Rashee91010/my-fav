  Drawing is a very fun thing to do, I always draw things on my free time and sometimes even in school when I am bored. Drawing can be developed by anyone by lots and lots of practice. My drawings are good in my opinion. I practice drawings everyday for fun and to improve my skills. I also sometimes search tutorials on how to draw some things. Sometimes my aunt draws with me, although her drawings are not too bad lol. I like to draw colourful things as they are vibrant and suit my drawing style.
